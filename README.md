# Automation
Tools and documentation for automating data ingest pipelines.

Following the example of the `crosscut-metadata` repository, we should start assembling a list of issues, and then group them into a project.

Issues that we have discussed to date:
* Sample data that we can ingest and a sample pipeline.
* Use of identifiers: What, how, when. (Mike: Let's get started at that. Can we use our sample code for that?)
